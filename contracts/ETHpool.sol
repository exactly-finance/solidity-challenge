Summary
ETHPool provides a service where people can deposit ETH and they will receive weekly rewards. 
Users must be able to take out their deposits along with their portion of rewards at any time. 
New rewards are deposited manually into the pool by the ETHPool team each week using a contract function.

Requirements
Only the team can deposit rewards.
Deposited rewards go to the pool of users, not to individual users.
Users should be able to withdraw their deposits along with their share of rewards considering the time when they deposited.
Example:

Let say we have user A and B and team T.

A deposits 100, and B deposits 300 for a total of 400 in the pool.
Now A has 25% of the pool and B has 75%. 
When T deposits 200 rewards, A should be able to withdraw 150 and B 450.

What if the following happens? 
A deposits then T deposits then B deposits then A withdraws and finally B withdraws. 
A should get their deposit + all the rewards. 
B should only get their deposit because rewards were sent to the pool before they participated.

    How it works?
    First of all, we need to understand that the reward mechanism cannot be automatic. (No FOR or WHILE allowed!)
    So, the stakeholders by themselves need to calculate their own reward (Don't worry, a function will do for us)

    Because the staking cannot be negative, we will save the accumulation of rewards proportional to the pool at the time of deposit.
    For each stakeholder, we will save the composition of the pool at the time of staking.
    To calculate the reward, we will substract the sum of rewards at the current time minus the composition of the pool at the time of staking for each user.
    This is the explanation of why cannot be automatic at the time of deposit rewards.

    Some assumptions has been taken:
    - Users withdrawn all of the staking and rewards. No partial withdraw allowed (Well, in fact, can be a full withdraw with a new deposit of the diff)
    - Users cannot add funds to their staking (As above, we can consider a full withdraw, and a new staking)
    - Some constants will be multiplied for an arbitrary big constant (10^18), to reduce rounding errors in division.
    - Can be optimized for gas consumption. But for this challenge and for educational purposes, we can take the risk. And testnet is "free".
    - Bugs? Everywhere. Not ready for production or resale.
